## My open source projects
### Aync-profiler utils
I created some tools that help me with profiling big application with [Async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler): 
* [Collapsed stack viewer](https://github.com/krzysztofslusarski/collapsed-stack-viewer)
* [Collapse JFR](https://github.com/krzysztofslusarski/collapse-jfr)
* [Continuous async-profiler](https://github.com/krzysztofslusarski/continuous-async-profiler)

### JVM/GC logs analyzer
Here is my open source JVM and GC logs analyzer:
* Source code is available [here](https://github.com/krzysztofslusarski/jvm-gc-logs-analyzer) 
* Web part is deployed on [gclogs.com](http://gclogs.com/)
