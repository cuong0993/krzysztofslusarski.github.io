# [Java][JVM Logs][GC Logs] Monday with JVM logs - heap before GC

## JMX monitoring

The _Heap before GC_ chart can be generated by probing through JMX. You can generate it the same way as _Heap after GC_ but insted of
```#memoryUsageAfterGc``` you need to fetch ```#memoryUsageBeforeGc``` property.
