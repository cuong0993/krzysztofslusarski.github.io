# [Java][JVM][Tuning][Profiling] _Biased lock_ disabled, again
## Big fat warning

This article shows some JVM tuning using some JVM flags. It helped with application described below, but it doesn't mean, that it will help in your application. 
**You should never use any JVM flags without knowing what consequences they may produce.**

## About _biased lock_
From Oracle documentation:

> -XX:+UseBiasedLocking 
> 
>Enables a technique for improving the performance of uncontended synchronization. An object is "biased" toward the thread which first acquires its monitor via a monitorenter bytecode or synchronized method invocation; subsequent monitor-related operations performed by that thread are relatively much faster on multiprocessor machines. Some applications with significant amounts of uncontended synchronization may attain significant speedups with this flag enabled; some applications with certain patterns of locking may see slowdowns, though attempts have been made to minimize the negative impact.

## Current state

Currently flag **-XX:+UseBiasedLocking** is enabled by default in JDK 8-14, but it is disabled and deprecated in JDK 15 ([JEP 374](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/374)).

## Why this optimization can hurt?
Besides the fact, that documentation mentions:

> (...) some applications with certain patterns of locking may see slowdowns (...)

there is one more aspect to consider. Revoking _biased lock_ is a _safepoint operation_, which means it needs a Stop-the-world phase to do its job. This phase stops every application thread, so this may hurt. 

## JVM logs
With unified logger we can trace _safepoint operations_ with ```Xlog:safepoint```, but also _biased lock_ can be traced with ```Xlog:biasedlocking```.

```
[safepoint        ] Application time: 0.1950250 seconds
[safepoint        ] Entering safepoint region: RevokeBias
[biasedlocking    ] Revoking bias with potentially per-thread safepoint:
[biasedlocking    ] Revoking bias of object 0x00000007efbe15d0, mark 0x00007fa06805d305, type org.springframework...<removed, sorry>, prototype header 0x0000000000000305, allow rebias 0, requesting thread 0x00007fa068064800
[biasedlocking    ]  Revoked bias of object biased toward live thread (0x00007fa06805d000)
[biasedlocking    ]  Revoked bias of currently-unlocked object
[safepoint        ] Leaving safepoint region
[safepoint        ] Total time for which application threads were stopped: 0.0003424 seconds, Stopping threads took: 0.0000491 seconds
```

From that log we can understand what objects had _biased lock_, and how many STW phases were done just to revoke _biased lock_.

This can be nicely presented on pie chart. Following chart shows %count of _safepoint operation_ type.

Usually %count is not what is really interesting, we need to look at time spent in those phases. Fortunately, from safepoints log we can also create pie chart that shows time wasted by each _safepoint operation_.

For those who prefer numbers we can also see this information in table:

![alt text](/assets/biased/2.png "chart 2")

So in this application revoking _biased lock_ needs:

```
(count(RevokeBias) + count(BulkRevokeBias)) / (totalCount)
```
substituting with numbers (in blue frames on table) we have :

```
(254389 + 11815) / 367681 = 72%
```
**72%** of all STW phases. Time spent in those phases was:

```
(totalTime(RevokeBias) + totalTime(BulkRevokeBias)) / (totalTimeOfSTW)
```
substituting with numbers (in red frames on table) we have:

```
(51419.93 + 24277.09) / 523393.73 = 14%
```
**14%** of all STW phases time (without time to safepoint).

## Context - tuned application 
* **JDK 11u4** by Oracle
* SpringBoot with embedded Tomcat
* Stateful web application
* Multiple instances (20) with **4 vCPU**
* Heap size **8GB**
* Peak usage between 17:00 and 18:00 (Monday-Friday)
* There is almost no thread synchronization in application, most of thread synchronization is done in frameworks and JDK.
* Around **200** Java **threads** are running between 17:00 and 18:00

## Expectations
What I excpect from application with _biased lock_ disabled:

* **~72%** less STW phases
* I expect that time spent by user in application may drop by **~2%**
* nice to have - less memory consumption, since bug [JDK-8240723](http://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8240723) will not be involved

## State before tuning - peak usage
Data from peak usage from 1 day and 4 nodes:

![alt text](/assets/biased/3.jpeg "chart 3")

![alt text](/assets/biased/4.jpeg "chart 4")

![alt text](/assets/biased/5.png "chart 5")

Revoking _biased lock_ costs **14%** of all STW phases.

From user perspective: AVG time of processing requests in peak is **~410ms**.

## Tuning
Tuning is done simply by disabling one option through JVM arguments:

```-XX:-UseBiasedLocking```

## State after tuning - peak usage

Data from peak usage from 1 day and 4 nodes:

![alt text](/assets/biased/6.jpeg "chart 6")

![alt text](/assets/biased/7.jpeg "chart 7")

![alt text](/assets/biased/8.png "chart 8")

From user perspective: AVG time of processing requests in peak is **~397ms**. 
Comparing worst result from nodes without _biased lock_ to best result from nodes with _biased lock_,
the node without it was **2%** faster from user perspective. Results were gathered for 1 week.

## Results

* Count of STW phases was reduced by **71%**
* Time spent in STW phases was reduced by **10%**
* User time in application was reduced by at least **2%** (**2-8%** with average **3%**)
* Memory footprint of JVM process was lower on machines without _biased lock_

## Final words

This is fifth application where I disabled _biased lock_ on JVM 11. Four times it helped, **one time it has degraded the performance**.
