# [Java][JSP][Spring Boot] Spring Boot + good old JSP/Tags = disaster

This article is not about profiling, this time I want to warn you about the **Spring Boot defaults**, that combined with the **JSP pages ang tags** can cause functional 
issues in your application. This issue was found by my friend, I'm just an article writer :) 

I know that you may think that no one uses the JSPs anymore. This issue occurred in one of our six-year-old applications, that we migrated from the core Spring at the standalone Tomcat to 
the Spring Boot.

## The application 

You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/krzysztofslusarski/articles-spring-boot-jsp){:target="_blank"}

Let's create a simple Spring Boot application with JSP

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class JspApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer {
    @Override
    protected SpringApplicationBuilder configure(SpringApplicationBuilder application) {
        return application.sources(JspApplication.class);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(JspApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

```java
@Controller
class JspController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return "hello";
    }

    @GetMapping("/2")
    public String hello2() {
        return "hello2";
    }
}
```

... with the properties:

```properties
spring.mvc.view.prefix: /WEB-INF/jsp/
spring.mvc.view.suffix: .jsp
logging.level.root=DEBUG
```

Let's create two JSP pages ```hello.jsp``` and ```hello2.jsp``` with the same content:

```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<%@taglib prefix="inc" tagdir="/WEB-INF/tags" %>

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>
Hello
<inc:included/>
</body>
</html>
```

... and one tag file ```included.tag```:

```jsp
<%@tag pageEncoding="UTF-8" %>
<b>Included hello</b>
```

## The Spring logs

Let's run the application and open URLs:

* ```http://localhost:8080/``` 
* ```http://localhost:8080/2```

In the Spring logs we can find:

```
org.apache.jasper.compiler.Compiler      : Generated /tmp/tomcat.8080.12985973738122585578/work/Tomcat/localhost/ROOT/org/apache/jsp/tag/web/included_tag.java total=5 generate=4 validate=1

```

The **scary part** is that the Java files from the JSP/Tags are generated and compiled in **```/tmp```** directory. That directory can be deleted any time
by any of your administrators, by the cron job or other external tools like ```tmpfiles.d```. 
[Here](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/centos-rhel-67-why-the-files-in-tmp-directory-gets-deleted-periodically/){:target="_blank"} is an explanation when _CentOS_ removes files from ```/tmp```.   

## Let's cause the disaster

Here is how to create an error:
* Start the application
* Open ```http://localhost:8080/```
* Remove ```work``` directory: ```rm -fr /tmp/tomcat*```
* Open ```http://localhost:8080/2```

You will get **HTTP 500**. In the logs we can see:

```
2021-04-05 17:27:01.558 ERROR 45318 --- [nio-8080-exec-4] o.a.c.c.C.[.[localhost].[/].[jsp]        : Servlet.service() for servlet [jsp] threw exception

org.apache.jasper.JasperException: Unable to compile class for JSP: 

An error occurred at line: [10] in the jsp file: [/WEB-INF/jsp/hello2.jsp]

7: </head>
8: <body>
9: Hello
10: <inc:included/>
11: </body>
12: </html>


An error occurred at line: [10] in the jsp file: [/WEB-INF/jsp/hello2.jsp]

7: </head>
8: <body>
9: Hello
10: <inc:included/>
11: </body>

```

## Fix

You need to set the **base directory** of your embedded Tomcat to some more persistent location. You can set it in ```application.properties```:

```properties
server.tomcat.basedir=/path/to/persistent/location
```

## Update: issue at Spring Boot project

I've created an issue [25890](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25890).
