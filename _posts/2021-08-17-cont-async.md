# [Java][Profiling] Continuous profiling with async-profiler

## If you speak Polish ...

there is a webinar at Warsaw Java User Group about that topic [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c0rys3sV9Q){:target="_blank"}.

## Async-profiler

You can download async-profiler from [GitHub](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler){:target="_blank"}. I'm using the latest **1.8.x** version, but
I have a plan to migrate to **2.0**.

## The continuous profiling concept

A "classic" profiling concept is to run a profiler on the application when you need to understand why the application perform not the way you want.

A continuous profiling concept is to run a profiler all the time, dumping the profiler output to some storage. When the application performs not the way you want,
you simply take the profiler output from the storage.

## How to run in?

You can run async-profiler from your Java code, or externally from your shell. 

### Shell

Here is the simplest way to run async-profiler in continuous mode (dump output every **60 seconds** in **wall** mode):

```shell
while true
do
	CURRENT_DATE=`date +%F_%T`
	./profiler.sh -e wall -f out-$CURRENT_DATE.jfr -d 60 MainClass
done
```

I use such a script when someone asks me to help him with his application. I just run it on ```screen```. 

If you want you can do it by ```cron```, you simply need to run such a script:
```shell
./profiler.sh stop MainClass > /dev/null
CURRENT_DATE=`date +%F_%T`
./profiler.sh start -e wall -o jfr -f out-$CURRENT_DATE.jfr MainClass
```

And add an entry to your ```crontab```.

### Java

Here is a part of Java code that runs async-profiler in continuous mode:

```java
AsyncProfiler asyncProfiler = AsyncProfiler.getInstance();

DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd_HH:mm:ss");

while (true) {
    String date = formatter.format(LocalDateTime.now());
    asyncProfiler.execute(
        String.format("start,jfr,event=wall,file=out-%s.jfr", date)
    );
    Thread.sleep(60 * 1000);
    asyncProfiler.execute(
        String.format("stop,jfr,event=wall,file=out-%s.jfr", date)
    );
}
```
You need to add dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>tools.profiler</groupId>
    <artifactId>async-profiler</artifactId>
    <version>X.Y.Z</version>
</dependency>
```

And you need to put ```libasyncProfiler.so``` file to any of ```java.library.path```.

### SpringBoot

If you have a Spring/SpringBoot application you can just use a starter written by me and Micha≈Ç Rowicki:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.krzysztofslusarski</groupId>
    <artifactId>continuous-async-profiler-spring-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.5</version>
</dependency>
```

Read **[readme](https://github.com/krzysztofslusarski/continuous-async-profiler){:target="_blank"}** first.

## How much does it cost?

In case of overhead I didn't see any overhead in **wall** mode.

In case of storage, the outputs from one day in **JFR** format weight up to **3GB** in my applications.

## Why do I use **wall** mode and **JFR** format?

I work at an insurance company. The most precious resource we have is the time of our employees. We want to focus on optimizing that resource, so the 
**wall** mode is most suitable for us.

The **JFR** format contains more information than other output that async-profiler offers. It contains:

* Thread id
* Stacktrace
* Thread state (if that thread is in the CPU or not)
* Timestamp

From the **JFR** format you can generate collapsed stack output. If you filter the data, so the output contains only stacktraces that are in the CPU, then you 
have a similar output to the **CPU** mode. It is not as good as the original **CPU** mode, it doesn't contain kernel frames, but it is usually "good enough" for me.

If you filter the data by period of time and thread then you can see what a single thread has been doing in that time. Such a possibility combined with
_access logs_ from your server are extremely powerful tools. 

If you use async-profiler in the  **1.X.X** version you can use my tool to convert **wall @ JFR** format to both **wall** and **CPU** collapsed stack outputs. My 
tool is on  [GitHub](https://github.com/krzysztofslusarski/collapse-jfr){:target="_blank"}.  **It doesn't work with async-profiler 2.0**.

## When is that useful?

First the continuous profiling solves the same problems as "classic" profiling, but it is easier, because you don't need to run profiler on demand, it is running
all the time.

### Outages

This is a use case of such a profiling when it completely shines. If you had an outage with profiler in continuous mode you can gather the profiler output from
the outage moment and see what was happening. Here is the flame graph of **10 minutes** work of an application:

![alt text](/assets/cont/no-outage.png "chart 3")

And that is the flame graph of the same application **during outage**:

![alt text](/assets/cont/outage.png "chart 3")

Usually during an outage there occurs a new very wide bar at the flame graph (if the outage is caused by **java process**). You just need to zoom in on that
part, and you know an answer why there is an outage.

### Performance degradation

This pattern is also useful when you have a performance degradation, for example: after a new deployment. You just need to take older profiler outputs
from your archive and compare it to the current one and look for differences.
