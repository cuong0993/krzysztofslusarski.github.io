# [Java][JVM][Memory leak][Profiling][Spring] Spring Boot + Spring Security + Apereo CAS + Concurrent Session Control = Heap memory leak
## Application configuration

Just two dependencies, nothing sophisticated:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-cas</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Spring security configuration:
```java
@Override
protected void configure(final HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    ...
    http
        .sessionManagement()
            .maximumSessions(1)
        ...
    ;
}
```

The ```maximumSessions``` parameter enables _Concurrent Session Control_ feature. After such a configuration the application let Spring to initialize
```CasAuthenticationFilter``` with its defaults.  

## How do I know that there is a memory leak?

What I usually do is to look at the _heap after GC_ chart. You can generate such a chart from _GC logs_. Such a chart for a **stateful application** that has memory
leak looks like this: (one week period)  

![alt text](/assets/casboot/1.jpg "img")

When there is no memory leak the chart looks like this:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/2.jpg "img")

What I'm looking for is the size of the _heap after GC_ when the application has the lowest usage. If that size grows every day then I assume that there **may be**
heap memory leak.

## Simplified application

Unfortunately I cannot show you the _heap dumps_ of a real production system. It contains too sensitive data. I've created a simplified application to recreate the
problem. To show the leak quicker I configured it:

```properties
server.servlet.session.timeout=1m
```

I've also created listener to gather information about session creation and destruction by _Tomcat server_:

```java
@Slf4j
@WebListener
public class CustomSessionListener implements HttpSessionListener {
    @Override
    public void sessionCreated(HttpSessionEvent sessionEvent) {
        log.info("New session is created. " + sessionEvent.getSession().getId());
    }

    @Override
    public void sessionDestroyed(HttpSessionEvent sessionEvent) {
        log.info("Session destroyed. " + sessionEvent.getSession().getId());
    }
} 
```

Let's run this application and see how such a session looks at the heap after creating one session. After a successful login, we can see in the log:

```
pl.ks.boot.leak.CustomSessionListener    : New session is created. 1CA551A1BAC6BA0988643147CE02F4E8
```

At the heap we can find **one** ```StandardSession``` object:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/3.png "img")
 
## _Path to GC root_ 

When _Garbage collector_ finds **alive objects**, it **starts** its work from objects called _GC roots_. Those objects **are alive by its definition**, for example
following objects are _GC roots_:
* Local variables
* Static variables
* Active Java threads

and many more. 

If any **object is alive** it means that there is a _path_ of references from any of the _GC roots_ to it. We can look at such a _path_ at _heap dump analyzer_:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/4.png "img")
![alt text](/assets/casboot/5.png "img")

The ```StandardSession``` object has **two** _paths to GC roots_:

* First is managed by _CAS client_ by its ```SingleSignOutHandler```
* Second is managed by _Tomcat server_ by its session ```StandardManager```

## Session timeout

After we wait **one minute** we can see new entry in my log file:

```
pl.ks.boot.leak.CustomSessionListener    : Session destroyed. 0F554402B686467A4BF8FC2E2248E5FA
```

When we look at this log and creation one we can see a curious thing:

```
pl.ks.boot.leak.CustomSessionListener    : New session is created. 1CA551A1BAC6BA0988643147CE02F4E8
pl.ks.boot.leak.CustomSessionListener    : Session destroyed. 0F554402B686467A4BF8FC2E2248E5FA
```

**The session ID has changed**. Ok, this is fully supported by ```HttpServletRequest``` API:

```java
public interface HttpServletRequest extends ServletRequest {
    ...
    String changeSessionId();
    ...
}
```

Let's look at the _heap dump_ after session timeout:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/6.png "img")

There is still **one** ```StandardSession``` object, which is a memory leak, because we have no active session in the application. Let's look at the _path 
to GC roots_:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/7.png "img")

The path managed by _Tomcat server_ has disappeared, but **the one** managed by _CAS client_ still exists.

## _CAS client_ source code 

Let's look:

```java
public final class SingleSignOutHandler {
    ...
    /** Mapping of token IDs and session IDs to HTTP sessions */
    private SessionMappingStorage sessionMappingStorage = new HashMapBackedSessionMappingStorage();
    ...
}
```

```java
public interface SessionMappingStorage {
    /**
     * Remove the HttpSession based on the mappingId.
     * 
     * @param mappingId the id the session is keyed under.
     * @return the HttpSession if it exists.
     */
    HttpSession removeSessionByMappingId(String mappingId);

    /**
     * Remove a session by its Id.
     * @param sessionId the id of the session.
     */
    void removeBySessionById(String sessionId);

    /**
     * Add a session by its mapping Id.
     * @param mappingId the id to map the session to.
     * @param session the HttpSession.
     */
    void addSessionById(String mappingId, HttpSession session);
```

The ```SessionMappingStorage.removeBySessionById()``` method is called from:

```java
public final class SingleSignOutHttpSessionListener implements HttpSessionListener {
    ...
    @Override
    public void sessionDestroyed(final HttpSessionEvent event) {
        if (sessionMappingStorage == null) {
            sessionMappingStorage = getSessionMappingStorage();
        }
        final HttpSession session = event.getSession();
        sessionMappingStorage.removeBySessionById(session.getId());
    }
    ...
}
```

Let's debug the _CAS client_ code. As strange as it sounds, debugging the library/framework code is sometimes **the only way** to understand the reason of the 
memory leak. I have added 2 breakpoints at:

```
org.jasig.cas.client.session.HashMapBackedSessionMappingStorage#addSessionById
org.jasig.cas.client.session.HashMapBackedSessionMappingStorage#removeBySessionById
```

After the login the first method was executed, and after **session timeout** the second method was also executed. At the log file there was an entry:

```
pl.ks.boot.leak.CustomSessionListener    : New session is created. 7B0CCD97AC979672771D34562D6D6211
``` 

The view I saw after stopping on ```removeBySessionById``` method was:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/8.png "img")
  
So _CAS client_ wants to remove session with id ```BFBEE2D66588F33DCA1C60F5CDDCFDC3```, but in its storage there is only the ```7B0CCD97AC979672771D34562D6D6211```
entry. So it looks like the _CAS client_ **does not support session ID change**. 

## What options do we have? 

We can:
* **Fix _CAS client_ by ourselves**, by adding implementation of ```javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionIdListener``` which modifies the map in
 ```HashMapBackedSessionMappingStorage```
* Find out **why our application is the changing session ID** and try to make it stop 

Let's go with the second options.

## Spring and Tomcat debugging

Let's put a breakpoint at ```org.apache.catalina.connector.Request#changeSessionId()```, and see the stacktrace:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/9.png "img")

**The session id change** is triggered by the Spring ```ChangeSessionIdAuthenticationStrategy```:

```java
public final class ChangeSessionIdAuthenticationStrategy extends AbstractSessionFixationProtectionStrategy {
	@Override
	HttpSession applySessionFixation(HttpServletRequest request) {
		request.changeSessionId();
		return request.getSession();
	}
}
```

It is executed from ```onAuthentication()``` method from ```CompositeSessionAuthenticationStrategy``` class. Let's put a breakpoint at the constructor of that
class:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/10.png "img")

The ```ChangeSessionIdAuthenticationStrategy``` is added to ```delegateStrategies```. The stack is initialized by the ```AbstractSecurityBuilder```. When we 
look at the source of the previous frame at the stack:

```java
public final class SessionManagementConfigurer<H extends HttpSecurityBuilder<H>>
		extends AbstractHttpConfigurer<SessionManagementConfigurer<H>, H> {
    ...
	private SessionAuthenticationStrategy getSessionAuthenticationStrategy(H http) {
        ...
		if (isConcurrentSessionControlEnabled()) {
			SessionRegistry sessionRegistry = getSessionRegistry(http);
			ConcurrentSessionControlAuthenticationStrategy concurrentSessionControlStrategy = new ConcurrentSessionControlAuthenticationStrategy(
					sessionRegistry);
			concurrentSessionControlStrategy.setMaximumSessions(this.maximumSessions);
			concurrentSessionControlStrategy.setExceptionIfMaximumExceeded(this.maxSessionsPreventsLogin);
			concurrentSessionControlStrategy = postProcess(concurrentSessionControlStrategy);

			RegisterSessionAuthenticationStrategy registerSessionStrategy = new RegisterSessionAuthenticationStrategy(
					sessionRegistry);
			registerSessionStrategy = postProcess(registerSessionStrategy);

			delegateStrategies.addAll(Arrays.asList(concurrentSessionControlStrategy,
					defaultSessionAuthenticationStrategy, registerSessionStrategy));
		}
		else {
			delegateStrategies.add(defaultSessionAuthenticationStrategy);
		}
		this.sessionAuthenticationStrategy = postProcess(
				new CompositeSessionAuthenticationStrategy(delegateStrategies));
		return this.sessionAuthenticationStrategy;
	}
    ...
}
```

After debugging this code you can see, that ```ChangeSessionIdAuthenticationStrategy``` is added in the ```if (isConcurrentSessionControlEnabled())``` block and
its instance is stored in the ```defaultSessionAuthenticationStrategy``` field. This field is also calculated in that method:

```java
public final class SessionManagementConfigurer<H extends HttpSecurityBuilder<H>>
		extends AbstractHttpConfigurer<SessionManagementConfigurer<H>, H> {
    ...
	private SessionAuthenticationStrategy getSessionAuthenticationStrategy(H http) {
        ...
		SessionAuthenticationStrategy defaultSessionAuthenticationStrategy;
		if (this.providedSessionAuthenticationStrategy == null) {
			// If the user did not provide a SessionAuthenticationStrategy
			// then default to sessionFixationAuthenticationStrategy
			defaultSessionAuthenticationStrategy = postProcess(this.sessionFixationAuthenticationStrategy);
		}
		else {
			defaultSessionAuthenticationStrategy = this.providedSessionAuthenticationStrategy;
		}
        ...
	}
    ...
}
```

So it looks like we could override it with the other instance of ```AbstractSessionFixationProtectionStrategy```. Let's google how we can change it. 
[The first result](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-session){:target="_blank"} shows we can manage it by:

```java
http.sessionManagement()
  .sessionFixation().migrateSession()
``` 

Our options are:

![alt text](/assets/casboot/11.png "img")

Which one is appropriate for your application is yours to decide. The _session fixation_ feature is a protection against the
[attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation){:target="_blank"}, so it is good to have this feature. We can switch from ```changeSessionId``` to
```migrateSession```, which implementation looks like:

```java
public class SessionFixationProtectionStrategy extends AbstractSessionFixationProtectionStrategy {
    ...
	@Override
	final HttpSession applySessionFixation(HttpServletRequest request) {
		HttpSession session = request.getSession();
		String originalSessionId = session.getId();
		this.logger.debug(LogMessage.of(() -> "Invalidating session with Id '" + originalSessionId + "' "
				+ (this.migrateSessionAttributes ? "and" : "without") + " migrating attributes."));
		Map<String, Object> attributesToMigrate = extractAttributes(session);
		int maxInactiveIntervalToMigrate = session.getMaxInactiveInterval();
		session.invalidate();
		session = request.getSession(true); // we now have a new session
		this.logger.debug(LogMessage.format("Started new session: %s", session.getId()));
		transferAttributes(attributesToMigrate, session);
		if (this.migrateSessionAttributes) {
			session.setMaxInactiveInterval(maxInactiveIntervalToMigrate);
		}
		return session;
	}
    ...
}
```

This strategy uses ```session.invalidate()``` method, which will trigger ```sessionDestroyed``` event and the _CAS client_ will remove it from its repository.

## Where is the bug?

From my perspective the bug is in _CAS client_, which **doesn't support changing session id**.
